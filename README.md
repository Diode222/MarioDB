# MarioDB
A levelDB-based database, now is implementing stand-alone function based on C/S. After the stand-alone function is completed, cluster functions will be added.
MarioDB supports unstructured data.

## Client
There is a MarioDB_Client(https://github.com/Diode222/MarioDB_Client) for MarioDB, I have not write a real client, it's only for testing. But when I finished MairoDB's work, I will finish this client too.
